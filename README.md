## The role of CEBPa in the inflammatory response 

 

The transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein Î± (C/EBPa) has a key role in stem and progenitor cell function as it regulates the 
differentiation towards the myeloid lineage. 
As a pioneer transcription factor, it is able to bind 
nucleosome-bound DNA and associate to chromatin remodelers to 
establish new enhancers35. C/EBPa mutations are found in 15-19% of cytogenetically normal AML cases. 
The most frequent type of mutation leads to the expression of an N-terminally truncated variant of the protein, termed p30, 
instead of the full-length isoform, p42. The p30 isoform is sufficient for commitment to a myeloid fate, and the absence of p42 results in the 
transformation and expansion of the myeloid lineage. Also, it has recently been shown that loss of C/EBPa confers a competitive advantage to HSCs in 
the context of chronic inflammation. Although the consensus in the field is that acquisition of leukemic properties in C/EBPa-mutant cells is due to the 
transcriptional changes promoted by the p30 isoform, it still remains unclear what specific transcriptional programs are altered and how do they promote a 
selective advantage.  

The main mutation in C/EBPa found in AML patients consists of a frame-shift mutation that results in the aberrant expression of a shorter isoform (p30) 
instead of the normally expressed longer one (p42). To model the C/EBPa AML mutation, HPC-7 cells (which do not endogenously express C/EBPa) were transfected with 
plasmids containing either the p42 isoform or the p30 isoform. P42 and p30 are bonded to ERT2 (estrogen receptor), so that it localises in the cytoplasm until its 
induction with tamoxifen (ligand), which will translocate to the nucleus and only then p42 and p30 will be able to function. This fusion was performed to avoid 
undesired differentiative effects derived from the presence of the p42 isoform in the nucleus. We have also observed that AML patients carrying this C/EBPa
mutation have a reduced response to inflammation. To study the effects that the introduction of p30 had on HPC-7 capacity to respond to an immune challenge 
like LPS on a transcriptional level, RT-qPCR were performed. We observed that after an acute activation (2h) the expression of some acute inflammatory response 
genes like Ccl5, Cxcl2 or Il12b was not induced as much as in the cells with the long isoform of C/EBPa p42.  

### ChIP-seq experiments
H3k27ac ChIP-seq was performed for all samples: HPC-7 cells transfected with either p30, p42 or empty vector (EV) and subjected or not to LPS treatment (LPS vs UT).  
ER ChIP-seq was performed for p30 and p42 to check if immunoprecipitation of the bound estrogen receptor could be successfully used to pull down CEBPa.

H3K27ac is associated with the higher activation of transcription and therefore defined as an active enhancer mark. H3K27ac is found at both proximal and distal regions of transcription start site (TSS).
